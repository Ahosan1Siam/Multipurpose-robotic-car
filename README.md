# Multipurpose-robotic-car
This is an Arduino based Hardware project.
This Multipurpose robotic Car is a four-wheeled Car/Robot that moves in a surface smoothly, detect the smoke, measures Humidity, Temperature 
, longitude and latitude, shows time and date through a digital clock and
also works as a security device of any place. This car is a self-controlled
car which can move by taking command from keypad and switching to
car mode and every feature can be selected by a menu. The menu will
be displayed on the LCD display and the user will be able to access the
menu using keypad. Our main goal is to reduce the accident caused by
fire and make the home more secured when user is not around.
